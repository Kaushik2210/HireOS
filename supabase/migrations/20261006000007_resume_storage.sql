-- Private storage for original resume files.
--   * bucket is private: nothing is reachable without a short-lived signed URL
--   * size and type limits are enforced by storage itself, in addition to the app
--   * objects must be named {user_id}/{resume_id}.pdf|docx, and users only touch their own folder
--   * no update policy: files are immutable
